A php library for generating one-time passwords according to [RFC 4226](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) (HOTP Algorithm) and [RFC 6238](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) (TOTP Algorithm)

This library is compatible with Google Authenticator apps available for Android and iPhone.
It is also compatible with other applications such as [FreeOTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fedorahosted.freeotp) for example.

## The Release Process

The release process [is described here](doc/Release.md).

## Prerequisites

This library needs at least `PHP 7.1`.
It has been successfully tested using `PHP 7.1` and nightly branch.

For older PHP versions support, please use release [`8.3.x`](https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/otphp/tree/v8.3.0) of this library.

## Installation

The preferred way to install this library is to rely on Composer:

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/otphp
```

By default, documentation and test environment are excluded.
If you want to test the library or get the documentation, please add `--prefer-source` option:

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/otphp --prefer-source
```

## TOTP or HOTP?

This library supports both `TOTP` and `HOTP`.

`TOTP` is a time based one-time password. It lives only for a few seconds (the `period`).
You just have to be sure that the clock of your server and your device are synchronized.
__This is the most common OTP__.

`HOTP` is a counter based one-time password. Every time a password is used, the counter is updated.
You have to verify that the server and the device are synchronized.

## How to use

To create an OTP object, just use the static `create` method. Your object will be able to generate passwords:

```php
<?php
use OTPHP\TOTP;

$otp = TOTP::create();
echo 'The current OTP is: '.$otp->now();
```

In the example above, we use the `TOTP` class, but you can use the `HOTP` one the same way.

Then, you have to configure you applications. 
You can use the provisioning Uri (`$otp->getProvisioningUri();`) as QR Code input to easily configure all of them.

We recommend you to use your own QR Code generator (e.g. [BaconQrCode](https://packagist.org/packages/bacon/bacon-qr-code)).
If you do not have your own generator, the classes provide a convenient way to get an Uri to the Google Chart API which will generate it for you:

```php
$googleChartUri = $totp->getQrCodeUri();
echo "<img src='{$googleChartUri}'>";
```

Now that your applications are configured, you can verify the generated OTPs:

```php
$otp->verify($input); // Returns true if the input is verified, otherwise false.
```

## Advanced Features

* [Customization](doc/Customize.md)
* [Application Configuration](doc/AppConfig.md): get the provisioning Uri
* [Factory](doc/Factory.md): from a provisioning Uri to an OTP object
* [Window](doc/Window.md): the window parameter
* [Q&A](doc/QA.md): Questions and Answers

## Upgrade

* [From `v8.x` to `v9.x`](UPGRADE_v8-v9.md)
* [From `v9.x` to `v10.x`](UPGRADE_v9-v10.md)

### Base 32 Encoder

Please note that the internal Base32 encoder changed on versions `8.3.2` and `9.0.2`.

**Before**

```
use Base32\Base32;

$encoded = Base32::encode('foo');
```
**After**

```
use ParagonIE\ConstantTime\Base32;

$encoded = Base32::encode('foo');
```
