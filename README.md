A php library for generating one time passwords according to [ RFC 4226 ](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) (HOTP Algorithm) and [ RFC 6238 ](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) (TOTP Algorithm)

This library is compatible with Google Authenticator apps available for Android and iPhone. It is also compatible with other applications such as [FreeOTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fedorahosted.freeotp) for example.

## The Release Process

The release process [is described here](doc/Release.md).

## Prerequisites

This library needs at least `PHP 7.1`.
It has been successfully tested using `PHP 7.1` (stable and nightly branches).

For older PHP versions support, please use release `8.x` of this library.

## Installation

The preferred way to install this library is to rely on Composer:

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/otphp
```

By default, documentation and test environment are excluded.
If you want to test the library or get the documentation, please add `--prefer-source` option:

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/otphp --prefer-source
```

## TOTP or HOTP?

This library provides both `TOTP` and `HOTP`.

`TOTP` is a time based one-time password. It lives only for a few seconds (the `period`).
You just have to be sure that the clock of your server and your device are synchronized.
This is the most common OTP.

`HOTP` is a counter based one-time password. Every time a password is used, the counter is updated.
You have to verify that the server and the device are synchronized.

## How to use

Have a look at [How to use](doc/Use.md) to initialize and generate your first OTP.
